The purpose of this course is to become familiar with R as a programming language in order to perform simple bioinformatics analysis independently. We will cover how to use R and Rstudio, learn how to install packages from repositories such as CRAN and Bioconductor, introduce basic programming concepts and data structures in R and lead you into the tidyverse. The latter is a popular collection of packages which we will use in practice for data manipulation and visualization. To prepare for this course make sure that you have R in version 3.6 or larger (e.g. https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ for Windows) and Rstudio installed (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Please also install git (e.g. https://git-scm.com/download/win for Windows).
